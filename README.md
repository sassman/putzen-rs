# purify-cli CLI

purify-cli

## What does purify-cli?

In short, purify-cli solves the problem of cleaning up build or dependency artifacts.

## Quick Start

### Install

To install the purify-cli, you just need to run

```bash
cargo install --force purify-cli
```

(--force just makes it update to the latest `purify-cli` if it's already installed)

**Note** the binary is called `purify` (without `-cli`)

to verify if the installation was successful, you can run `which purify` that should output similar to

```sh
$HOME/.cargo/bin/purify
```

### Usage

```sh
$ purify --help

TODO: --help output goes here
```

## About 

In short, putzen solves the problem of cleaning up build or dependency artifacts.
It does so by a simple "File" -> "Folder" rule. If the "File" and "Folder" is present, it cleans "Folder"

It also does all this fast, means in parallel (if the filesystem supports it).

### Supported Artifacts

putzen supports cleaning artifacts for:

| type       | file that is checked | folder that is cleaned |
|------------|----------------------|------------------------|
| rust       | Cargo.toml           | target                 |
| javascript | package.json         | node_modules           |
| CMake      | CMakeLists.txt       | build                  |

furthermore, it does also support:
- It can do run a dry-run (`-d`)
- Interactive asking for deletion
- Sums up the space that will be freed

## Quick Start

### Install

To install the `putzen`, you just need to run

```bash
cargo install putzen-cli
```

**Note** the binary is called `putzen` (without `-cli`)

to verify if the installation was successful, you can run `which putzen` that should output similar to

```sh
$HOME/.cargo/bin/putzen
```
